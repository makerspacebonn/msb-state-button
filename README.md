# State Button for the Makerspace Bonn
A button for our makerspace, that can be pressed, to change the publicly 
available opening information in our space. Lights indicate the current
space state.

With very little python knowledge, this project started 
from an idea of one of the Makerspace Bonn members, which 
was idling fo a while. Since the inspiring module used micropython,
it was used here too for learning adventures.
